<p>I spent last night dreaming of food so today I decided to follow along with Mackenzie Child's <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QhdzE1yNs-0" target="_blank">Recipe Box</a> App tutorial, and build one for myself. In the seven days I've been doing this, this is the third app I've built. I think I'm finally really getting how Rails works and the format of MVC and how to go from a wireframe to a functioning web application. Though this has definitely not been without major frustrations, the absolute high I get after shipping something is beautiful. I love doing this stuff. I really do. </p>
