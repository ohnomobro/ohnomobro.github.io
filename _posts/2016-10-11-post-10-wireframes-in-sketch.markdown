title: post[10] = Wireframes in Sketch
layout: post
---
<p>The past few days I've been playing around with wireframes, essentially digitally sketching out a few web page designs before I open up my code editor. Back when I was first learning how to code pages from scratch, I would get really stuck at the design aspect. Mostly because in learning how to code, all the tutorials are really coding focused. Design's always last. But for me, the coding parts of the webpage didn't start sticking until I pressed design first. Which is strange to me because while I like design, I don't think of myself as very great a design. I don't know if that's because I essentially mainly studied art in college or just the way my mind is wired...but thinking about coding in terms of design, UI, and UX first helps me make more sense of the more complicated parts.</p>

<p>I can loosely sketch out what I have in my mind on a couple sheets of graph paper. I can see an app's interface before I can see its code structure. Thankfully Sketch makes my visions come out more clearly.  It's much easier on my laptop, and enables me to play around with colors and fonts. The coding part comes easy once I have a wireframe to work off of. It's like writing out all the methods for a Class, where all the parts are open and easy to see.</p>

<p>It's just so much easier in Sketch, which already comes with several web page templates and templates for mobile design. I also love the free resources on Sketch website. I played around with some icons today...and just kind of lost myself in mapping out a few projects I want to create. I've used Photoshop before for some of this stuff...but Sketch is definitely made for online design. </p>
