<p>After yesterday's frustrations, I just used the day to code my way through building a Pokeball.</p>
<p>I don't know much about Pokemon, but I feel incredibly satisfied having completed that. Thank you <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AIcHVLdmVSY&list=PLfdtiltiRHWFLBMhfTwYdCbCIVcL2bBAL" target="_blank">Code Course.</a></p>
<p>On another note, <a href="http://exercism.io/" target="_blank">Exercism</a> is quiet literally the best way to relax myself into doing problems in Ruby. I will count today a success.</p>
