<p>Sometimes, like today, I just have to take a step back and reflect. Especially when I'm frustrated with the way projects I'm working on are going and I'm making stupid mistakes and all the code just keeps blurring in front of my eyes. And the overwhelming anxiety at the thought that nobody will hire me, even though I can at least tell you a little bit about everything on a job listing. I didn't know those things a year ago.</p>

<p>A year ago I didn't even think I could be a programmer. Like, even though I always dabbled in html/css and did actually take some CS classes, I thought I'd missed my ship.  I went to a science and tech high school, where the science/tech just left me feeling disappointed, not encouraged. I didn't pursue it. I have a degree in visual arts. I've worked in theatre, art museums, art camps. Programming fits both. It's like a missing puzzle pieces in the gaps between two sides of a puzzle. It works for me. </p>

<p>There was a time where I wasn't okay with 'not-knowing' something because I equated lack of knowledge with weakness, but as I stumble past pride and arrogance, I realize that there's a lot of power in saying 'I don't know'. </p>

<p>But sometimes I just get so mad that I don't know enough. I'm not learning fast enough. Even though the only metric I can compare against is 'past me', not anyone else. It's hard but I can look back and see so much progress.</p>
