<p>Today I decided to play around with taking a design idea drawn out in basic wireframe and turn it into code. The original repo hails from the <a href="https://github.com/Ada-C6/meowspace">Ada Cohort 6 github.</a> It's nice not to have to come up with the page idea and the design, and definitely a good exercise in what works when thinking of UI/UX.</p>
<p> I decided to not fork the repository. Instead I just used the wireframes drawn out in the README.md as a guide. I feel like I have become an HTML/CSS warrior. As I was doing it, I really wanted to turn this into a functioning app. Which sounds like a project for ma√±ana.</p>
