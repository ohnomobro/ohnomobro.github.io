Today's goal was to set up a personal website to showcase my work. It was a lot more difficult than I thought it would be. Having no prior experience with dealing with domains and hosting, it took me longer than I liked to get set up. I finally was able to settle on using Bluehost. Then once I bought my domain and got into my account, it took my even longer to figure my way through Bluehost's file system. Well, I figured it out and now I am the proud owner of moriahbrowning.com. The current layout is just a placeholder. Tomorrow I will go back in and do some hand-coding until I get a design that I actually like.
