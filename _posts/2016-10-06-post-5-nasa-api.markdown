title: post[5] = NASA API
layout: post

<p>I dove headfirst into coding today, deciding to fiddle around with the NASA API, using <a href="https://emkaydeum.wordpress.com/2016/04/28/tutorial-build-a-rails-app-using-the-nasa-astronomy-photo-of-the-day-api/" target="_blank">this tutorial</a> as a guide. It was definitely more fun than frustrating even though it took me two run throughs because Terminal quit during a bundle install then kept giving me errors when I tried to install more gems. Definitely worth it to be able to get into the guts of using an API in an app. I also got to try out some Bourbon, which I do not understand and definitely will need more clarification on in the near future.</p>

<p>For now, I'm just satisfied in the fact that I built something, even though its super beginner-ish. It's also NASA and space and photography. Things that I enjoy quite a bit. Tomorrow will bring other things, but tonight...</p>
