title: post[3] = Portfolio Site Frustration
layout: post
---
<p>Today I told myself that I would sit down and focus on coding out my portfolio site. It's two hours until midnight and I still have nothing that I am excited about. I know that its useless to get bogged down in this, especially three days into this 30-in-30 day, but for some reason I cannot let the fact that I hate the current design go. </p>
<p>I go with one idea and then scrap it once its actually gone from my sketch to actually web. Maybe I'm being nitpicky...I just can't. I'm trying to keep it as simple as possible but there's so much I want to do with it. I think I'm overthinking it. </p>
<p>Tomorrow will be a better day. I can do this.</p>
