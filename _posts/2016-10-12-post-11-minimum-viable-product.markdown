title: post[11] = Minimum Viable Product
layout: post
---
<p>More than anything, I think this month has been an exercise in being satisfied with what I can get done in one day, i.e. my own version of minimum viable product. When it's something that I'm testing, I'll usually write out some quick code to make the tests pass...screwing re-factoring and sometimes processing time. Going back to some of the stuff I created just a week ago, makes my mind cringe. But I am definitely learning what mvp means to me. Things beyond 'does it work?' and more like:
<ul>
<li>when i look back on this a month from now will i understand what i did?</li>
<li>does the end product look anything like the wireframes?</li>
<li>will i regret what i didn't get to do when i ship it?</li>
</ul> 
 </p>

<p>And then sometimes I just stumbled into things that don't make any sense but work...</p>
