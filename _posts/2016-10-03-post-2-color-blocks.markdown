Today was busier than I thought it would be and I almost didn't get any coding things done. Which would have sucked considering this is only Day 2. Anyway, the original plan was to build an Etch-a-Sketch....but that didn't happen. Instead I have a 10-by-10 color grid, where all the blocks change color when you click it. I think tomorrow I'm going to try to figure out how to just change one block with one click, and then every block with a double-click. And then maybe I'll add some other mouse and click events that trigger other changes...like the container background. That's a thing for tomorrow.
