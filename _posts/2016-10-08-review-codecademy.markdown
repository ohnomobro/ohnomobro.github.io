<p><a href="https://www.codecademy.com/learn" target="_blank">Codecademy</a> is probably my favorite resource for learning how to code, but that could be because it was my first resource when I started learning back in December. It's perfect for beginners who aren't sure if they're really that into code and for those who want to review the basics. They offer introductory courses in a breadth of languages, and a paid option that guides you through more advanced/interesting projects. It's fun, easy to use.</p>

<p>Things I love:</p>
<ul>
<li>Being able to do coding within the browser in the Codeacademy environment</li>
<li>Being able to try out a variety of coding languages</li>
<li>Tracking my progress through courses with badges and a streak monitor.</li>
</ul>

<p>Things I wish for:</p>
<ul>
<li>Linking to github for projects created during the courses</li>
<li>A mobile version, even if it just consists of the extra reading they have now added to their courses.</li>
<li>For the bugs in the new update to be fixed.</li>
<li>More intermediate courses.</li>
</ul>

<p>All in all, it's a great tool to get your feet wet, but it is nowhere near comprehensive enough. Codecademy is like riding a bike with training wheels.  In the beginning days of learning, I would pull up Sublime and try to replicate some of the things I learned and couldn't.</p>

<p>Having completed every language course (because I couldn't not...I can get very obsessive with unfinished things), I definitely feel the need to press beyond Codecademy's offerings. But it looks like there are some things in the works for Codecademy. I'm excited to see what the future brings. </p>
